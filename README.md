# Top AI Papers - A Review ⭐️

## Description

Many of the most significant AI papers since 2022 are listed in this collection and are organized by publication date. This repository covers five fields : natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, multimodal learning, audio processing and reinforcement learning. Papers are primarily ranked by number of citations and by their degree of innovation in the field. If you have any recommendations for compelling papers, we'd be delighted to consider them. Feel free to give this repository a star if you enjoy the work.

## Taxonomy
To select the most relevant papers, we chose subjective limits in terms of number of citations. Each icon here designates a paper type that meets one of these criteria.

:fire: (Historical Paper): more than 10k citations and a decisive impact in the evolution of AI.

:star2: (Important Paper): more than 50 citations and state of the art results.

:arrow_double_up: (Trend): 5 to 50 citations, recent and innovative paper with growing adoption.

:newspaper: (Decisive Article): decisive work that was not accompanied by a research paper.
